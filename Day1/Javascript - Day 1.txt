-What is Javascript:
	-it's an interpreted language like Ruby and PHP
	-the conversion happens when you execute
	-working with Vanilla JS
	-link to external files through script tags

-to open browser console:
	windows: ctrl + SHIFT + J
	Mac: Command + Option + J

-Data Types & Variables
	-statements typically end in ";"
	-long comments = /* <comment> */ 
	-short comments = // <commment>
	-alert is the popup box
	-directly on the page is document.write('Your message') 
	or console.log('your message')

-Variables
	-declare and initialize in one statement: 
		var y = 2;
		console.log(y);
	-you want variables to start with letters, $, or _
	-case sensitive 
	-prefer camelCase for multipleWords instead of under_score
	-pick a naming convention and stick with it

-Primitive Data Types
	-string, numbers, boolean
	-Arithmetic Operators: eg -, +, *, /, % (modulus - remainder of...)
		-eg: 20%7 = 6 (20/7 has remainder of 6)
	-if you want to use quotes for a long string use double quotes for the 
	one you want as a quoted sting and single quotes for the whole string
	- "+=" adds two strings together for variables

-JS can only recognize one value type per variable so if you mix a number with
a string then JS will turn the number into a string

-Variable Scobe -Global (definded outside a function) vs local (inside a function)

-equal means same values, identical means same values AND same type
	eg Equals: 77 == '77'   
	vs Identical: 77 === 77
