JavaScript Object Notation - JSON
-the good thing about JSON is that it works in other sources
-cookies are outdated: there's only a max amount of cookies
	you can have per location ---> now we're using the modern "web storage"
		-session storage --> goes away when user closes browser
		-local storage --> always there until deleted
-for AJAX, you have to put the functions inside the fetch enviorment or
	the variable will not be defined.
