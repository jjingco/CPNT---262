Create a Quiz

Create 5 or more quiz questions with a total of 3 different types of inputs.

Display the questions on your page.

Require that each question be filled out.

When a user submits the quiz, score it and display their score.

Once you've finished creating your quiz, 
modify your code to only show one quiz question at a time.

Consider everything you've learned up through now. 
Make your quiz look and feel good. This could be a potential project 
for your portfolio.

When you are done, create a Github page for this project and 
submit a link to the actual quiz website.
